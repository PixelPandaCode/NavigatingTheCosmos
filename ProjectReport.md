### Introduction

#### Background and Context

The exploration of space, an endeavor that has captured human imagination for centuries, stands at the forefront of scientific and technological advancement. It represents not just a quest for knowledge but a fundamental drive to understand our place in the universe. The challenges of navigating through the vastness of space, with its countless stars and galaxies, require innovative solutions and advanced computational techniques. Our project situates itself within this grand pursuit, focusing on the simulation of spaceship navigation through the celestial expanse. By leveraging pathfinding algorithms, we aim to chart the most efficient courses between stars, thus contributing to the broader field of space exploration and computer science.

#### Research Question

At the heart of our project lies the question: "How can various pathfinding algorithms be applied and compared in the context of space navigation to determine the most efficient routes between stars?" This question drives our research and development efforts, guiding us towards a deeper understanding of algorithmic efficiency and application in the vast and variable spatial configurations of outer space.

#### Rationale

This project is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it addresses a fundamental challenge in space exploration: the efficient navigation through the cosmos. With space missions becoming more ambitious, the ability to find optimal routes between distant celestial bodies becomes increasingly critical. Secondly, our work contributes to the field of computer science by applying and comparing different pathfinding algorithms in a unique context, thereby expanding the knowledge base of algorithmic applications. Lastly, it fills a gap in current research by exploring the impact of gravitational wells and other astrophysical phenomena on navigation algorithms, offering insights into their performance under real-space conditions.
